First Revison Notes:
Boosted tree seemed to be the models favored choice
I only use 10 iterations for selecting the model allowing more may increase accuracy
25% evaluates at around 89
50% of data use evaluated at around 93% accuracy
80% evaluates at 90.91 but only tests on 1 class
75% evaluates at 94 and tests on two classes
>90% always evaluates to 100
